# Simple Simulation Engine V1.0 alpha
This simulator allows you to Run 3 different simulations, add new simulation objects and manage settings for each individual object like
<ul>
* object speed
* External force
* Does the object has a rigid body?
* Is the object effected by gravity?
* Does the object static and doesn't interact with the physics system
* Change object collider between circle collider and box collider
* Change collider size
* Remove the collider at all
* Remove object mesh or add it again
* Change object Transformation like position, rotation and scale
<\ul>
<\br>
Also you can change global variables "Environment Constraints" like 
<ul>
* Gravity vector
* Air density
* Fraction coefficient
<\ul>
<\br>
